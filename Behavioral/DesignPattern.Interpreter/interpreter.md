# Interpreter Design Pattern

## The Interpreter Design Pattern is a Behavioral Design Pattern that defines a grammatical representation of a language and provides an interpreter to deal with this grammar. The main idea is to define a domain language (a small language specific to your application) and interpret expressions in that language. It is useful when interpreting sentences in a language according to a defined grammar.

## That means the Interpreter Design Pattern Provides a way to evaluate language grammar or expression. This pattern is used in SQL Parsing, Symbol Processing Engines, etc.
