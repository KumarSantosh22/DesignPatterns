# Observer Design Pattern

## Observer Design Pattern Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## The observer design pattern has two main components. They are as follows

Subject: They are also called Publishers. When a change occurs to a subject, it should notify all its Subscribers/Observers.
Observers: They are also called subscribers. They listen to the changes in the subjects.
