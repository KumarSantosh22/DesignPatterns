# Decorator Design Pattern

## The Decorator Design Pattern in C# allows us to dynamically add new functionalities to an existing object without altering or modifying its structure, and this design pattern acts as a wrapper to the existing class.

## That means the Decorator Design Pattern dynamically changes the functionality of an object at runtime without impacting the existing functionality of the object.
