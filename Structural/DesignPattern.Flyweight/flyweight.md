# Flyweight Design Pattern

## The Flyweight Design Pattern reduces the number of objects created, decreases memory footprint, and increases performance. It’s especially useful when many objects share some common properties.

## That means the Flyweight Design Pattern is used when there is a need to create many objects of almost similar nature. A large number of objects means it consumes a large amount of memory, and the Flyweight Design Pattern provides a solution for reducing the load on memory by sharing objects.
