# Proxy Design Pattern

## Proxy Design Pattern provides a surrogate (act on behalf of another) or placeholder for another object to control access to it. 

## The Proxy Design Pattern allows us to create a class that represents the functionality of other classes. The proxy could interface with anything, such as a network connection, a large object in memory, a file, or other resources that are expensive or impossible to duplicate.
