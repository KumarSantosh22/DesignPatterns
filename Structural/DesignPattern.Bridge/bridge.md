# Bridge Design Pattern
## The Bridge Design Pattern Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
## This pattern involves an interface that acts as a bridge between the abstraction class and implementer classes. It is useful in scenarios where an abstraction can have several implementations, and you want to separate the implementation details from the abstraction.
